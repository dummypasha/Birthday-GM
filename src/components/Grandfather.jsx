        <p>
          For every festival, every little happiness 🌸  
          her heart always knew where to go.
        </p>

        <p>
          Her grandfather’s home was more than a place —  
          it was comfort, warmth, and love.
        </p>

        <p>
          He held her hand,  
          making sure she never felt alone 🕊️
        </p>

        <p>
          Without many words,  
          he always believed in her.
        </p>

        <p>
          Among all the siblings,  
          his support for her was gentle, special, and constant.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even today 🤍  
          his love walks beside her —  
          quietly, endlessly, forever.
        </p>
