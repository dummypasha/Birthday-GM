        <h1>Her Roots</h1>

        <p>Parents who trusted her dreams.</p>
        <p>Who stood behind her silently, proudly.</p>

        <p>
          They never rushed her.
        </p>

        <p>
          In every quiet prayer,  
          there was hope, strength, and endless love 🤍
        </p>

        <p>
          The confidence she carries today ✨  
          was gently built at home.
        </p>

        <p>
          No matter how far she goes,  
          their love always walks with her.
        </p>
