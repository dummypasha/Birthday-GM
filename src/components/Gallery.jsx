      <span>Heyyy… first of all, I don't know how to start🤍✨</span>
      <span>
        The way you care for your friends and your close people is honestly the cutest thing ever.
        that’s rare.
      </span>
      <span>
        The way you respect your family, the way you value their feelings —
        that shows how strong and grounded you are and you’re always mindful not to hurt them,
      </span>
      <span>
        You know exactly how to behave in every situation —
        classy when needed, fun when it’s light, mature when it matters.
      </span>
      <span>
        You’re hardworking, independent, and building your own path.
        But what makes you even more special is your dhairyam —
        that quiet courage you carry inside.
      </span>
      <span>
       Now that you’re in the Other country, building your life on your own,
       standing on your own feet — that independence honestly looks really good on you.
      </span>
      <span>
        Even when things are tough, you don’t run away.
        You face it. Calmly and Strongly.
      </span>
      <span>
        You fall, you overthink, you feel deeply —
        but you always rise again. That resilience? Queen energy 👑
      </span>
      <span>
        Being around you feels peaceful, safe, and positive for whoever it is.
        Soft heart + strong mindset.
      </span>
      <span>
        Just stay the same, okay?
        That soft heart + strong mindset + fearless dhairyam combo… it’s something really special 🤍✨
